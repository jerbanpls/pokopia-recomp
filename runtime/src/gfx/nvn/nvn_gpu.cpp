    //
    // What depends on a submission having been made, and how each is kept right with the worker:
    // - CPU waits on the timeline: wait_serial_blocking (render thread: slot reuse in acquire_slot, run_frame_sync readbacks, finish,
    //   tear_down) and wait_serial (game threads: nvnSyncWait, the low-latency GPU wait, compute out_fetch) first wait until the worker
    //   has submitted the serial (sw->wait_submitted, zone submit.wait_submitted), then on the timeline. A serial completed on the CPU
    //   (device lost, failed submit) counts as submitted.
    // - Polls (serial_done, poll_completed, nvnSyncWait with timeout 0) read the timeline value only: a value cannot be reached before it
    //   was submitted, so a poll never answers early; it answers "not yet" a little longer at most. want_flush is unchanged: `flushed`
    //   now means "handed to the worker", which will submit it without being asked again.
    // - Slot reuse (command pool / descriptor pool / upload ring / staging buffers reset in acquire_slot): only after the slot's serial
    //   completed on the GPU, which needs it submitted first (above). Frame trace / GPU pass query results are read there too.
    // - defer_destroy / Frame::defer: run in retire() when the timeline reached their serial: after the worker submitted it.
    // - Submit failure: the worker signals the timeline on the CPU (vkSignalSemaphore) and publishes, as flush_batch / present_batch_done
    //   did inline. Device lost: the worker submits nothing, completes the serial on the CPU and publishes, so no waiter hangs.
    // - Swapchain (acquire, recreate on resize / OUT_OF_DATE, present mode change from the pre-frame hook) and the frame slot's fence:
    //   present_on_render_thread drains the worker first (submit_drain), so the previous present has run and its `dirty` is visible.
    //   A screenshot frame drains right after queueing (it waits on the fence and reads the copy back).
    // - Pool mirror / compute copy-back paths wait through wait_serial (above); texture readbacks through run_frame_sync (above).
    // - Sparse binds (vkQueueBindSparse, nvn_gpu_texture.cpp) and the debug submit with vkQueueWaitIdle drain first: they must follow
    //   everything recorded before them on the queue.
    // - Shutdown: the render thread's last flush goes to the worker, then tear_down stops (drains) the worker before vkDeviceWaitIdle and
    //   before any object is destroyed; the renderer's submit queue is unset.
    // Queue access: the VkQueue stays protected by the one Device::queue_mutex (the worker holds it for submit + present; the one-shot
